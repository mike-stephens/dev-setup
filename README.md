# dev-setup
Personal development setup. Based on [thoughtbot's dotfiles](https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles) example.

## Getting Started

```
$ sudo apt update
```

### 1. Git

```
$ sudo apt install git
```

```
$ cd ~/

$ git clone THIS_REPO

```

### 2. Visual Studio Code

Heard some good things about it so let's give it a shot!

Install: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux

Will likely need to install this first:

```
$ sudo apt install gnupg
```
